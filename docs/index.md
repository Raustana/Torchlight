# Welcome!

This is the project page for the Lightbearer AI project, based off Malmo-Minecraft for UCI's CS175 AI Project!

The goal of the Lightbearer AI is to automatically determine the light level of its surroundings and place torches accordingly so no hostile monsters spawn within the area.

Navigation can be found at the top of the page.
